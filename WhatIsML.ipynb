    "## What Is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"If you torture the data enough, nature will always confess.\"** –Ronald Coase\n",
    "\n",
    "As a one line version—not entirely original—I like to think of machine learning as \"statistics on steroids.\"  That characterization may be more cute than is necessary, but it is a good start.  Others have used phrases like \"extracting knowledge from raw data by computational means.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques used in machine learning can be broken down into some broad categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a model to make novel predictions based on previous observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is a type of supervised learning in which the targets for a prediction are a set of categorical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a type of supervised learning in which the targets for a prediction are quantitative or continuous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning where you want to identify similarities among collections of items without an *a prior* classification scheme. You may or may not have an *a priori* about the number of categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general approaches to reducing the number of dimensions (i.e. features) in a dataset. One is by creating synthetic features that globally combine the raw features. Several different mathematical techniques are available for doing this. PCA is the oldest and most widely used method for decomposition of dimensional information."

    "The basic idea of a \"multilayer perceptron\" is a \"feed-forward\" artificial neural network, composed of \"neurons\" arranged in \"layers.\" A common illustration is similar to that at right. This idea of \"Hebbian networks\" has existed since the 1940s, but it really only became a machine learning technique with Paul Werbos' 1975 introduction of \"backpropagation\" as a means to train such networks. Either way, the ideas are fairly old.\n",

What makes a particular trained network special is the set of \"weights\" in the connections, illustrated and commonly named as subscripted  $w$ values.\n",

For example, the extremely power Inception v3 image classifier consists of approximately 23.8 million parameters across about 140 layers. Layers generally each have many more neurons than the dozen or fewer shown in textbook illustrations like the one above. Scikit-learn has basic neural network techniques, but their use is mostly for the uses that made sense more than five years ago.\n",

    "In machine learning models, we have to worry about twin concerns.  On the one hand, we might **overfit** our model to the dataset we have available.  If we train a model extremely accurately against the data itself, metrics we use for the quality of the model will probably show high values.  However, in this scenario, the model is unlikely to extend well to novel data, which is usually the entire point of developing a model and making predictions.  By training in a fine tuned way against one dataset, we might have done nothing more than memorize that collection of values; or at least memorize a spurious pattern that exists in that particular sample data collection.\n",

    "### Fake layers\n",
    "\n",
    "As an API design, some \"layers\" in PyTorch are not really layers in the proper sense, but are rather activation functions used by the previous layer.  An activation function is simply some functional form that describes how a neuron responds to its inputs in deciding whether or how much to fire to downstream neurons.  PyTorch layers that describe activation functions have no parameters of their own, and are more like adjectives or adverbs modifying the layer before them in the programmatic description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear layers are also sometimes called \"dense\" or \"fully connected.\"  The idea of a linear layer is that it gets inputs from every single neuron in its direct parent layer, weights those signals, then fires forward to every neuron in the child layer according to its activation function.  Most neural networks contain multiple linear layers; in fact before a few years ago, almost all or all layers in networks were linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Often deep neural networks (DNNs) will utilize \"dropout\" layers to randomly disable some neurons during training.  While this might seem counterintuitive that deliberately *not* utilizing some available neurons would be a good thing, in fact this is very helpful in reducing overfitting and co-adaptation of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrent layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) allow neurons on a particular layer to feed back into themselves.  This is often a good way to model time-dependent or other sequential data.  The special kind of RNN called \"Long Short-Term Memory\" is an enhancement that maintains more hidden state over multiple training passes.  There are other special kinda of RNNs as well.  Plain RNNs can suffer from the \"vanishing (or exploding) gradient problem\"—that is, the feedback from a training pass causes a neurons strength to trend toward zero (or infinity).  LSTMs and other specializations greatly mitigate that danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers are often useful for processing of 2-dimensional or higher dimensional inputs where proximity is an important relationship.  The prototypical example of this is images, which have regions in the field and important boundaries in their shapes.  Rather than connect every \"pixel\" to every other one, a hugely simplifying assumption can be made that adjacent or nearby pixels are the most relevant for understanding a particular one.  This can reduce the number of free parameters by orders of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pooling layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling is especially useful in coordination with convolutions.  These combine a number of neurons (but not an entire prior layer) into a single neuron.  For example, a particular 5x5 region of a 2-D picture might use on neuron in a pooling layer to represent its brightness or typical hue."
